I'm a somewhat young software engineer/scientist coming from northern Germany.
On paradigm I live by, is that in every area there is something interesting to discover.
If I find the time, I want to write more blogs about topics, which crossed my ways.

This blog is my way of showing gratitude too all bloggers/authors, which helped me to understand a topic of interest in more detail.
Maybe someday, some of my blogs will help someone in a similar way.
